# Introduction to Open Science

## What is Open Science?

<br>

> Open science is a set of principles and practices that aim to make scientific research from all fields accessible to everyone for the benefits of scientists and society as a whole.

--- UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science

## "Closed" Science

<br>

* Research published only in paywalled journals that not everyone can access

* Data that supports scientific results being unavailable

* Software, code, protocols, etc. being unknown, undocumented, or inaccessible

* Science not being accessible to communities that would benefit from it

## Principles of Open Science

<br>

1. Transparency, scrutiny, critique, and responsibility

2. Equality of opportunities

3. Responsibility, respect, and accountability

4. Collaboration, participation, and inclusion

5. Flexibility

6. Sustainability

## Principles of Open Science

* Today we'll mostly focus on the first principle

  - Transparency, or what we might call 'open scientific knowledge'

<br>

. . .

* Are our publications, data, metadata, protocols, educational resources, software, source code freely available to all?

<br>

. . .

(This is one end of a continuum of 'openness' -- depending on the context, nature of the data, etc., it may not be desirable to make all of these completely open in all circumstances)

## The Research Workflow

<br>

1. We design a study to answer a research question

<br>

. . .

2. We collect some data

<br>

. . .

3. We analyse the data and write a paper

<br>

. . .

4. The paper gets published

## The Research Workflow

<br>

* Usually, only 

> 4\. The paper gets published

results in any accessible output

. . .

<br>

(And often then it is behind a journal paywall and not accessible to all)

. . .

<br>

* **1.**, **2.**, and **3.** are often a black box, accessible only to the researcher themselves 

## Components of Open Scientific Knowledge

<br>

* Open protocols/documentation
* Open research data
* Open software/source code
* Open access publication

## Open protocols/documentation

<br>

* RCTs and systematic reviews now generally require registration and pre-specified protocols, e.g.
  - [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov) for clinical trials in the US
  - [ANZCTR](https://anzctr.org.au) in Australia/NZ
  - [PROSPERO](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/) for systematic reviews

<br>

* Usually not required for other study types, but still a good idea

## Open research data

<br>

* Open data allows other researchers to:
  - check the correctness of your analysis
  - combine your data with other sources (e.g. IPD meta-analysis)
  - use your data to answer questions you hadn't even thought of...

* For health data, it is very important to consider the appropriateness of data sharing:
  - is additional data preprocessing needed to ensure participant anonymity?
  - should there be restrictions on who can access data and for what purpose?

* If data is being shared, it needs to be documented clearly

# Data sharing -- a cautionary tale

## Open software/source code

<br>

* As with open data, sharing source code allows others to check the correctness of your analysis

<br>

* Wherever possible, the use of open source or freely-available software allows others (or yourself later) to replicate your work

## Open access publication

<br>

* Research is of no use if no one can access it...

* To ensure our research can reach the widest possible audience, aim for open access publishing whenever possible
  - Otago has 'Read & Publish' agreements with a number of publishers
    - <https://otago.libguides.com/research_publishing_impact/read-and-publish>

* Otherwise you can usually post either a 'pre-print' or 'post-print' (accepted manuscript) on an institutional (e.g. OURArchive) or other repository, sometimes after an embargo period.
  - [Sherpa Services](https://beta.sherpa.ac.uk/) provides an easy search function to look up journals' sharing policies
    
# Open Science Framework

## Open Science Framework

<br>

* At CMOR, we have started using the Open Science Framework (OSF) for collaborative open science

<br>

* <https://osf.io>

<br>

* The OSF allows both private work (within the research team) and public sharing for dissemination and accessibility

## Project organisation on the OSF

<br>

* Work on the OSF is organised into 'Projects', which can be nested to create a structured organisation for all of your files, data, code, protocols, and outputs

<br>

* Within a projected, nested sub-projects are referred to as 'Components'
  - The advantage of nesting components within a project is that each component can have its own permission settings (contributors, public/private access, etc)

## CMOR @ OSF {.smaller}

* We have set up such a nested structure for research projects at CMOR:

## Preregistration

* Preregistration is the practice of documenting your research plan at the beginning of your study and storing that plan in a read-only public repository (such as the OSF)
  - see <https://www.cos.io/initiatives/prereg>

* Preregistration, including a detailed analysis plan, helps to address issues of reproducibility through reducing the potential for bias in analysis and reporting

* See [**Create a preregistration**](https://help.osf.io/article/158-create-a-preregistration) for information on creating and submitting a preregistration for a project on the OSF
  - Note that once a preregistration is submitted and approved, you cannot make any changes (by design!), so check everything carefully
